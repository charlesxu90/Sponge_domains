Work flow of Domain analysis:

==========================================
1. Find new associated non-domain sequences from proteome
1) Remove domain sequences;
    -del_domain_seq.pl,
2) Run SECOM against non-Domain Sequences;
    -Run SECOM for different seed length, finally choose 6 (More comprehensive).
    -change config file, 0_split_file.pl, 
3) Run Clustalw for all clusters find from SECOM;
    -1_run_clustalw_folder.pl, 

==========================================
2. Cross-validate new motifs using blast # Useless, needs update
1) Find consensus sequences from Clustalw results;
    -2_select_rep_seq.pl, 2_run_sel_rep.pl
2) Run blastp for consensus seqs against ncbi_nr and other two sponge sequences dbs;
    -3_blastp_nr_local.pl
    -do I need Do it for AQ?
3) Search consensus seqs against pfam (including Pfam-A and Pfam-B) and other motif dbs;
    -Meant to find existing hits.
Combine all the infomation above by:
    -4_combine_pfam_blast_seq.pl, 4_sel_blast_info.pl, 4_sel_blast_XT_SC.pl, and combineColumn.pl

==========================================
3. Genome level scrutiny of new motifs using hmmer # Useless, MSA is not solid.
1) Retrieve proteomes of related species;
    -details in ~/db/species/;
2) Search all cluster profiles against all species;
    -1.pick_dom_seq.pl 
3) Retrieve matched sequences, do multiple sequences alignment;
#4) Create phylogenetic tree from alignments; ### Meet with problems, few species share this domain

===========================================
#4. Discovery potential domains from MSA ### Impossible for this study. MSA is not solid. P-value curve is not plausible.
1) Convert MSA into IDentity Curves (ID curves) ## Build models
    -Two methods: Counting and PWM
2) Convert ID Curves into P-values Curves
3) Smoothing of P-value Curves
    -Two methods: filter and wavelet
4) Partition of P-value Curves and find corresponding domains
    -B-H algorithm or threshold

===========================================
5. Potential domain analysis based on structural information
1) Using a better algorithm for MSA. (Probcons)
2) Retrieve Conserve PSSM/consensus seq for structural prediction.
3) Matching based on structural information.

===========================================
#6. Functional analysis of the new domains
1) Subcellular location of proteins;
    -predictProtein, 
    -others: psipred, raptorX, metaprdos, I-tasser
2) Homologous sequences functional annotations;
    -??? Remains to be see.
